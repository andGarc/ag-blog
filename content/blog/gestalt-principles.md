### TL;RD
The Gestalt principles can be used to understand how people interact with and create order out of visual stimuli.

There are 6 principles:  

	1.  Proximity: Things that are close together are perceived as belonging together.  

	2. Similarity: Things that look similar are perceived as belonging together. 

	3. Continuity: Our brains prefer to see smooth and continuous paths, even if there are gaps or interruptions.  

	4. Closure: Our brains tend to fill in missing information to create a complete image or object.  

	5. Enclosure: Objects that are enclosed by a boundary are perceived as belonging together.   

	6. Connection: Things that are connected in some way, either by shape or proximity, are perceived as belonging together.

## Proximity
Basically, things that are close together seem like they belong together.

The proximity principle can be very useful in data visualization because it can help make complex data easier to understand. By grouping related data points together, we can create a visual hierarchy and make it easier for the viewer to see patterns and relationships within the data.

For example, if we have a scatter plot with many data points, we can use the proximity principle to group data points that are related to each other, such as those that represent the same group or category. We can group related data points together and using color or size. This makes it easier for the viewer to quickly identify clusters of data points and see the patterns within each group.

## Similarity 
The similarity principle in Gestalt psychology means that things that look the same seem like they belong together.

We can also use the similarity principle to create visual cues that guide the viewer's attention. For example, we can use color or size to highlight data points that are similar to each other, making them stand out from the rest of the data.

## Enclosure
The enclosure principle in Gestalt psychology means that when something is surrounded by a boundary, it seems like it belongs together.

The enclosure principle can be very useful in data visualization because it can help us to visually organize and group related data points. By enclosing related data points within a boundary, we can create a visual hierarchy that makes it easier for viewers to understand the relationships between the data.

For example, in a chart or graph, we can use the enclosure principle to group related data points together. We might draw a box or a circle around a group of data points to show that they are related in some way, such as being part of the same category or group.

We can also use the enclosure principle to draw attention to specific data points or groups. By enclosing them within a boundary and using color or other visual cues, we can make them stand out from the rest of the data and draw the viewer's attention to them.

## Closure
The closure principle in Gestalt psychology means that our brains like to see things as complete shapes or objects, even if some parts are missing.

The closure principle can be very useful in data visualization because it can help us to create a sense of completeness and coherence in our visual representations of data. By using visual elements that suggest completeness, even when parts of the data are missing, we can help viewers to see the patterns and relationships within the data more easily.

For example, in a chart or graph, we can use the closure principle to show trends or patterns in the data, even when some data points are missing. We might draw a line or a curve that connects the data points, even if there are gaps in the data, to suggest a complete pattern.

We can remove unecessary parts from our graphs and still have our graphs as a cohesive unit, letting out data stand out. 

## Continuity 
Similar closure.
The continuity principle in Gestalt psychology means that our brains like to see things in a smooth and continuous way, without abrupt changes or interruptions.

Stripping away unnecessary elements allows out data to stand out more. 

## Connection
The connection principle in Gestalt psychology means that our brains like to see things that are connected in some way, either by shape or by proximity.

The connection principle can be very useful in data visualization because it can help us to create a sense of organization and structure in our visual representations of data. By using visual elements that suggest connection, we can help viewers to see the relationships and patterns within the data more easily.
